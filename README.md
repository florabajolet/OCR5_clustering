# Project 5: Clients clustering for an e-commerce company

*Keywords*: unsupervised learning, clustering, scikit-learn

## Goal
Make a segmentation of the clients. We are free to choose any king of marketing point of view for the segmentation. We must provide an actionable description of the clusters for the marketing team and analyse their stability over time to propose an appropriate maintenance period.
